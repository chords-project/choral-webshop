/**
 * <p> TLS Channel is a library that implements a ByteChannel interface to a TLS (Transport Layer Security) connection.
 * The library delegates all cryptographic operations to the standard Java TLS implementation: SSLEngine; effectively
 * hiding it behind an easy-to-use streaming API, that allows to securitize JVM applications with minimal added
 * complexity.</p>
 *
 * <p> In other words, a simple library that allows the programmer to have TLS using the same standard socket API used
 * for plaintext, just like OpenSSL does for C, only for Java, filling a specially painful missing feature of the
 * standard Java library.</p>
